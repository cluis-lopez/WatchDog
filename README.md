# WatchDog

Simple project to get real time data from a bunch of sensors and a USB camera connected to a Raspberry Pi into a web page.

Uses Python and few lines of Node in the Raspi, Java in the backend and Javascript (JQuery) in the web client. Messages are driven through Pusher and the backend is hosted in Google App Engine.
